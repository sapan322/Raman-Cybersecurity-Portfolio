##  Key Findings  

### **1. Static Analysis**  
- **File Hashes:**  
  - SHA-256: `92730427321a1c4ccfc0d0580834daef98121efa9bb8963da332bfd6cf1fda8a`  
  - MD5: `1d8562c0adcaee734d63f7baaca02f7c`  
  - **VirusTotal Score:** Detected by 60 out of 72 engines on VirusTotal, indicating strong evidence of malicious behavior.

- **Suspicious Strings Identified with FLOSS:**  
  - `CreateProcessW`, `ShellExecuteW`, `URLDownloadToFileW`, `InternetOpenUrlW`
  - `http://ssl-6582datamanager.helpdeskbros.local/favicon.ico`  
  - `C:\Users\Public\Documents\CR433101.dat.exe`  

- **PE Analysis with PEview:**  
  - Binary is not packed.  
  - Time Date Stamp: `2021/09/04` (compilation date).  
  - Imported functions indicate capabilities for process creation, network communications, and file downloads.  

---

### **2. Dynamic Analysis**  
- **Behavior Observed:**  
  - If the URL is reachable:  
    - Downloads `favicon.ico` and saves it as `CR433101.dat.exe`.  
    - Executes the downloaded file (second-stage payload). 
  - If the URL is unreachable:  
    - Malware deletes itself from the system.

- **Network Activity (captured with Wireshark):**  
  - HTTP GET request to:

    ```
    http://ssl-6582datamanager.helpdeskbros.local/favicon.ico
    ```

- **Host Activity (monitored with Procmon):**  
  - Creates `CR433101.dat.exe` in `C:\Users\Public\Documents`  
  - Executes ping `1.1.1.1` to test connectivity
  - Attempts silent self-deletion if execution fails

---

##  Tools & Techniques  

### **Static Analysis**  
- **FLOSS:** Extracted strings like `cmd.exe /C ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000 > Nul & Del /f /q "%s"`.  
- **PEview:** Identified imported functions and confirmed the binary is not packed.  

### **Dynamic Analysis**  
- **Wireshark:** Captured `HTTP GET` requests to the malicious URL.  
- **Procmon:** Tracked file creation and self-deletion behavior.  
- **INetSim:** Simulated internet connectivity for malware testing.
