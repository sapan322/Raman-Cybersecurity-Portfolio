# Wireshark
**Wireshark** is a powerful network traffic analyzer, commonly referred to as a sniffer. It provides deep packet inspection, real-time traffic analysis, and advanced filtering capabilities.

Key Wireshark’s features:
- Live traffic capture - – monitor packets in real-time
- PCAP import/export – analyze captured traffic offline
- Flexible filtering system – isolate relevant packets
- Packet searching and inspection – investigate network anomalies

## Using Wireshark for Malware Analysis
In a controlled malware analysis environment, Wireshark can be used to capture and inspect network signatures of malicious samples.

On a REMnux VM (running INetSim to simulate internet services for FLARE-VM), Wireshark helps track network activity when executing malware.

### Example: Extracting Network Signatures from an Unknown Malware Sample
**Scenario:**

Static analysis of a malware binary (using FLOSS) reveals embedded URLs, including:

```
http://ssl-6582datamanager.helpdeskbros.local/favicon.ico
```
To verify its activity dynamically, we capture network traffic.

**Steps:**

1. Apply the following filter to track requests for the suspicious URL:

```
http.request.full_uri contains "favicon.ico"
```

2. Execute malware on FLARE-VM (ensure FLARE-VM is using REMnux IP as its DNS server)

3. Wireshark detects an HTTP GET request to favicon.ico from FLARE-VM to REMnux

4. Use this data to create malware detection rules (e.g., YARA, Suricata, or Sigma signatures)
