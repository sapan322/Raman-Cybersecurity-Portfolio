# PEview – Portable Executable Structure Analysis
PEview is a lightweight tool that allows to quickly analyze the structure and content of 32-bit Portable Executable (PE) files.

A PE (Portable Executable) file is essentially a structured array of bytes. The PE format defines how Windows executables, DLLs, and drivers are structured.

Key Features of PEview:
- **Hexadecimal Representation** – View raw bytes and their character representations
- **PE Headers Inspection** – Analyze PE file headers for key metadata
- **Section Analysis** – Inspect executable code, data, and resources
- **Import & Export Tables** – Identify API calls used by the binary
- **Packed Binary Detection** – Spot signs of packing techniques

Each PE file follows a strict format that tells the OS how to handle it.
Some of the most important fields in the PE headers include:
- `IMAGE_SIGNATURE` - Identifies the target OS for which the PE was compiled
- `Time Date Stamp` - Shows the compilation timestamp or can reveal malware evasion techniques (e.g., Delphi compiler always marks files with 1992 as a timestamp)
- `PE File Sections` - Executable Code (.text), Data & Strings (.rdata, .data), Imports & Exports (Windows API functions)

### How to Identify a Packed Binary:
Compare `Size of Raw data` (actual file size) with `Virtual Size` (size when loaded into memory) in `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER`:

If Virtual Size is significantly larger than Size of Raw Data, the binary is likely packed or encrypted.

### Extracting Windows API Imports:
Malware can imports Windows API functions for execution, persistence, and evasion.

`.rdata SECTION` -> `IMPORT Address Table`
