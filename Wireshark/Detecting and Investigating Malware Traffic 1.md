## TRAFFIC ANALYSIS EXERCISE: DOWNLOAD FROM FAKE SOFTWARE SITE ([LINK](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2025/01/22/index.html))

## Description
Use Wireshark to detect and investigate malware traffic. Identifying malicious network behavior for protecting networks and responding to security incidents.

### Exercise details:

**BACKGROUND:**

You work as an analyst at a Security Operation Center (SOC). Someone contacts your team to report a coworker has downloaded a suspicious file after searching for Google Authenticator. The caller provides some information similar to social media posts at:

*https://www.linkedin.com/posts/unit42_2025-01-22-wednesday-a-malicious-ad-led-activity-7288213662329192450-ky3V/*

*https://x.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1882448037030584611*

Based on the caller's initial information, you confirm there was an infection.  You retrieve a packet capture (pcap) of the associated traffic.  Reviewing the traffic, you find several indicators matching details from a Github page referenced in the above social media posts.  After confirming an infection happened, you begin writing an incident report.


**LAN SEGMENT DETAILS FROM THE PCAP**

- LAN segment range:  10.1.17[.]0/24   (10.1.17[.]0 through 10.1.17[.]255)
- Domain:  bluemoontuesday[.]com
- Active Directory (AD) domain controller:  10.1.17[.]2 - WIN-GSH54QLW48D
- AD environment name:  BLUEMOONTUESDAY
- LAN segment gateway:  10.1.17[.]1
- LAN segment broadcast address:  10.1.17[.]255
 
**TASK**

For this exercise, answer the following questions for your incident report:
- What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
- What is the mac address of the infected Windows client?
- What is the host name of the infected Windows client?
- What is the user account name from the infected Windows client?
- What is the likely domain name for the fake Google Authenticator page?
- What are the IP addresses used for C2 servers for this infection?

## Steps:
Preparation: 
- Download pcap file and open in wireshark.
- Understand summury information from "Background":
  - Coworker dowload suspicious file from fake "Microsoft-Teams-App" malicious ad on google search.
  - Malware delivered by HTTP C2 server at 5.252.153[.]241 domains and IP addresses.

1. Filter traffic by "C2 ip address" source/destination:
   
   `ip.src == 5.252.153.241 || ip.dst == 5.252.153.241`
      
2. Packet `No. 5028` is first in communication with C2 server which are start in TCP 3-Way Handshake.

3. Packet `No. 5031` is `HTTP GET` request `/api/file/get-file/264872 HTTP/1.1`
4. Packet `No. 5033` is `HTTP GET` request `/api/file/get-file/264872 HTTP/1.1`
