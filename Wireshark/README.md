# Description:
Packet Sniffing â€“ Collect and Analyze Network Packets with Wireshark
Network traffic monitoring involves capturing, collecting, and recording data packets that travel across a network. A traffic analyzer is a software tool capable of intercepting and logging data as it moves through the network.

## Preparation:
Install Wireshark on Debian VM in Proxmox hypervisor.
