# Description:
Packet Sniffing â€“ Collect and Analyze Network Packets with Wireshark
Network traffic monitoring involves capturing, collecting, and recording data packets that travel across a network. A traffic analyzer is a software tool capable of intercepting and logging data as it moves through the network.

## Preparation:
Install Wireshark on Debian VM in Proxmox hypervisor.

### Protocols: (scenarious):
[ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)](https://github.com/sapan322/Raman-Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Wireshark/ICMP%20(Internet%20Control%20Message%20Protocol).md)
