# Raman Cybersecurity Portfolio  

## About Me  
I am Raman Sapunou, an IT enthusiast on the path to cybersecurity.  

Recently, I earned the [**CompTIA Security+**](https://www.credly.com/badges/17531add-3e8e-4cb1-99bb-c5ad4559cfc6/linked_in_profile) certification to pursue my passion for technology and cybersecurity. This certification provided me with a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts. My ultimate goal is to land my first job in the cybersecurity field.  

I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, a passion for learning, and problem-solving skills to address security challenges and emerging threats.
